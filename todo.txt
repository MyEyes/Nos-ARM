-proc creation has some bugs related to checking if memory exists
and should generally be double checked since the mapping of physical
to virtual memory seems very risky potentially if we are going to have more than 1Gig of phys memory

-ipc_ports should be able to be created and destroyed, kernel needs to keep track of the owners of ipc_ports

-There should probably be a general ressource manager for kernel ressources held by threads/processes

-Not sure how to handle files/streams yet. Through IPC message passing?
